XamlImage
=========

Have you ever got some vector graphics from a designer in XAML format and thought it would then be easy to just use these in your WPF application? If you have, you also know that this isn't as easy you should think. I mean, the designer gave you xaml, WPF loves xaml, why shouldn't it be easy?

Well, it's not and thats the goal of this project, to try and create some sort of control or something, that can help you in this situation.

For now it for WPF, but it could as well be for Silverlight, Windows Phone and Windows 8.


Maybe be able to do something like this:
``` C#
<XamlImage Source="Images/MyButton.xaml" />
```
I would like to have that - so this is what this project is for...when I get started on it.

If you already have a solution to this problem, please create an issue or fork and do a Pull Request, as I would like this to become a NuGet package in the future.
