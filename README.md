XamlImage
=========

Wouldn't it be nice if you could just reference a xaml file directly as the source of an Image in WPF?

Maybe be able to do something like this:
``` C#
<XamlImage Source="Images/MyButton.xaml" />
```
I would like to have that - so this is what this project is for...when I get started on it.

If you already have a solution to this problem, please create an issue or fork and do a Pull Request, as I would like this to become a NuGet package in the future.
